https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method

Since we know that control points P0 and P3 are always (0, 0) and (1, 1) respectively,
we can simplify the Bezier algorithm to:

```
x(t) = x0(1 - t)3 + 3x1(1 - t)2t + 3x2(1 - t)t2 + x3t3
x'(t) = 3(1 - t)2(x1 - x0) + 6(1 - t)t(x2 - x1) + 3t2(x3 - x2)
```

Further, they can be simplified to (Horner's method).

```
x(t) = (((1 - 3x2 + 3x1)t + 3x2 - 6x1)t + 3x1)t
x'(t) = 3(1 - 3x2 + 3x1)t2 + 2(3x2 - 6x1)t + 3x1
```

This allows us to calculate coefficients:

```
cx = 3.0 * p1x;
bx = 3.0 * (p2x - p1x) - cx;
ax = 1.0 - cx - bx;
```

And end up with:

```
x(t) = axt3 + bxt2 + cxt
x'(t) = 3axt2 + 2bxt + cx
```

This greatly simplifies things and makes it faster.
