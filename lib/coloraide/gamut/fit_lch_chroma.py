    Lch chroma gamut mapping class.

    Adjust chroma (using binary search).
    This helps preserve the other attributes of the color.
    Compress chroma until we are are right at the JND edge while still out of gamut.
    Raise the lower chroma bound while we are in gamut or outside of gamut but still under the JND.
    Lower the upper chroma bound anytime we are out of gamut and above the JND.
    Too far under the JND we'll reduce chroma too aggressively.

    This is a compromise between the CSS algorithm as described in: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#binsearch
    and what is used in https://github.com/LeaVerou/color.js. It optimizes the use of delta E calls to get somewhere
    in between CSS algorithm performance and the Color.js performance, but gets pretty close to the better chroma
    reduction.
