class LChChroma(Fit):
    """
    LCh chroma gamut mapping class.

    Adjust chroma (using binary search).
    This helps preserve the other attributes of the color.
    Compress chroma until we are are right at the JND edge while still out of gamut.
    Raise the lower chroma bound while we are in gamut or outside of gamut but still under the JND.
    Lower the upper chroma bound anytime we are out of gamut and above the JND.
    Too far under the JND we'll reduce chroma too aggressively.

    This is the same as the CSS algorithm as described here: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#binsearch.
    There are some small adjustments to handle HDR colors as the CSS algorithm assumes SDR color spaces.
    Additionally, this uses LCh instead of OkLCh, but we also offer a derived version that uses OkLCh.
