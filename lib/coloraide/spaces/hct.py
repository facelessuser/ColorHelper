"""
HCT color space.

This implements the HCT color space as described. This is not a port of the Material library.
We simply, as described, create a color space with CIELAB L* and CAM16's C and h components.
Environment settings are calculated with the assumption of L* 50.

Our approach getting back to sRGB is likely different as we are using a simple binary search
to help calculate the missing piece (J) needed to convert CAM16 C and h back to XYZ such that
Y matches the L* conversion back to Y. I am certain the Material library is most likely
employing further tricks to resolve faster. We also try to get as good round trip as possible,
which forces us to probably make more iterations than Material does (none of this has been confirmed).

As ColorAide usually cares about setting powerless hues as NaN, especially for good interpolation,
we've also calculated the cut off for chromatic colors and will properly enforce achromatic,powerless
hues. This is because CAM16 actually resolves colors as achromatic before chroma reaches zero as
lightness increases. In the SDR range, a Tone of 100 will have a cut off as high as ~2.87 chroma.

Generally, the HCT color space is restricted to SDR range in the Material library, but we do not have
such restrictions.

Though we did not port HCT from Material Color Utilities, we did test against it, and are pretty
much on point. The only differences are due to matrix precision and white point precision. Material
uses an RGB <-> XYZ matrix that rounds values off significantly more than we do. Also, while we
calculate the XYZ points from the `xy` points without rounding, they have rounded XYZ points. Lastly,
the gamut mapping algorithm we use is likely different even though it arrives at pretty much the same
result, so slightly different values can occur.

Material:

```
> hct.Hct.fromInt(0xff305077)
Hct {
  argb: 4281356407,
  internalHue: 256.8040416857594,
  internalChroma: 31.761442797741243,
  internalTone: 33.34501410942328
}
```

ColorAide:

```
>>> from coloraide_extras.everything import ColorAll as Color
>>> Color('#305077').convert('hct')
color(--hct 256.79 31.766 33.344 / 1)
```

Differences are inconsequential.

    Convert HCT to XYZ.

    Utilize bisect to find the best J that fulfills the current XYZ Y while
    keeping hue and chroma the same (assuming color is not achromatic).
    Not the most efficient, especially if you want to provide the best round
    trip possible. The official Material library that implements HCT, most
    likely has a number of shortcuts to help resolve the color faster, some
    may come at the cost of precision. Worth looking into in the future.
