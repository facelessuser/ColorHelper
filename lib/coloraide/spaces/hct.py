"""
HCT color space.

This implements the HCT color space as described. This is not a port of the Material library.
We simply, as described, create a color space with CIELAB L* and CAM16's C and h components.
Environment settings are calculated with the assumption of L* 50.

Generally, the HCT color space is restricted to sRGB and SDR range in the Material library, but we do
not have such restrictions.

Though we did not port HCT from Material Color Utilities, we did test against it, and are pretty
much on point. The only differences are due to matrix precision and white point precision. Material
uses an RGB <-> XYZ matrix that rounds values off significantly more than we do. Also, while we
calculate the XYZ points from the `xy` points without rounding, they have rounded XYZ points. Lastly,
the gamut mapping algorithm we use is likely different even though it arrives at pretty much the same
result, so slightly different values can occur.
