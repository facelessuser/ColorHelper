Contribution from the community is encouraged and can be done in a variety of ways: Bug reports. Reviewing code. Code patches via pull requests. Documentation improvements via pull requests. Bug Reports \ue157 Please read the documentation and search the issue tracker to try to find the answer to your question before posting an issue. When an issue is created, a template will be shown, please fill out the appropriate sections. If the template is not followed, the issue will be marked Invalid and closed. When creating an issue on the repository, please provide as much info as possible: Provide environment information by running Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Support Info . The information will be copied to the clipboard; paste the info in issue. Errors in console. Detailed description of the problem. Examples for reproducing the error. You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format for easy copy/paste. Provide links to 3 rd party syntax highlighting package you are using if applicable. The more info provided, the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue. Be prepared to answer questions and provide additional information if required. Issues in which the creator refuses to respond to follow up questions will be marked as stale and closed. Reviewing Code \ue157 Take part in reviewing pull requests and/or reviewing direct commits. Make suggestions to improve the code and discuss solutions to overcome weakness in the algorithm. Pull Requests \ue157 Pull requests are welcome, and if you plan on contributing directly to the code, there are a couple of things to be mindful of. Please describe the change in as much detail as possible so I can understand what is being added or modified. If you are solving a bug that does not already have an issue, please describe the bug in detail and provide info on how to reproduce if applicable (this is good for me and others to reference later when verifying the issue has been resolved). Please reference and link related open bugs or feature requests in this pull if applicable. Make sure you've documented or updated the existing documentation if introducing a new feature or modifying the behavior of an existing feature that a user needs to be aware of. I will not accept new features or changes to existing features if you have not provided documentation describing the feature. Continuous integration tests on are run on all pull requests and commits via Travis CI. When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted. You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting. If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge. Running Validation Tests \ue157 Tip If you are running Sublime on a Mac OS or Linux/Unix system, you run all tests by by running the shell script (assuming you have installed your environment fulfills all requirements below): chmod +x run_tests.sh ./run_tests.sh There are a couple of dependencies that must be present before running the tests. As ST3 is the only current, actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests. Unit tests are run with pytest . You can install pytest via: pip install pytest The tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command: py.test . Linting is performed on the entire project with flake8 , flake8-docstrings , and pep8-naming . These can be installed via: pip install flake8 pip install flake8-docstrings pip install pep8-naming Linting is performed with the following command: flake8 . Documentation Improvements \ue157 A ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation. If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation. Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests. There shouldn't be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation. You don't have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of MkDocs , the Material theme , and PyMdown Extensions to render the docs. You can preview the docs if you install these two packages. The command for previewing the docs is mkdocs serve from the root directory.

When the cursor is on a CSS color, the tooltip will appear. When entering a color into a supported file, the color palette panel will be triggered so you can optionally insert a color from a saved palette. The panel will popup after either: # , rgb( , rgba( , hsl( or hsla( . Note Popups are provided by the mdpopups dependency. Color Info \ue157 The Color Info Panel will show a preview of the color, and other format variations of the color such as: color name, hex , rgb , rgba , hsl , and hsla format; if desired, you can convert the selected color to one of the shown formats by clicking the link to the left. From the color info panel, you can launch a color picker, bookmark colors as a favorite, add/save the current color to a palette of your choice, or open the Palette Panel to select a pre-saved color from an existing palette. Color Picker \ue157 The internal color picker can be launched from the view's context menu, the command palette, or from the Color Info Panel . When launched it will use the color under the cursor (if available) as its starting color. The internal color picker is contained inside a tooltip. It has a color map section at the top where different colors can be selected. It shows various valid CSS formats of the colors at the bottom. And it shows either rgba channels or hlsa channels; a toggle is available to switch between them. The color channels are coarse, but can generally allow you to get close to a color that you like. As you select colors in the channel the selections will shift revealing more selections until the bounds of the color channel are reached. If you need finer selections, you can click the label to the left and scrollable tooltip with much finer selections will appear so that you can select the best suited value. If you would like to pick from a list of CSS color names, you can select the CSS color names link and a CSS Color Names panel will open: If you would like to directly enter a different color, you can select the enter new color option. An input panel will be open that can receive a color in the hex form of #RRGGBBAA where RR is the red channel, GG is the green channel, BB is the blue channel, and AA is the alpha channel. To select a color, just click the >>> link to the right of the CSS format you want. Add Color Panel \ue157 The Add Color Panel presents the user with the option of either adding a color to an existing palette or creating a new global or project palette and adding the color to it. When creating a new palette, the user will be presented with a input box to type the name of the palette to create. Palette Panel \ue157 The Palette panel will allow you to view the current saved palettes: favorites, saved user palette, and saved project palettes. The Favorites palette and user palettes are found in your Packages/User/color_helper.palettes . Project palettes are stored in your actual project file; if one does not exist, it will be stored in memory. By clicking a palette, you will be taken to the Color Panel to select a color to insert into the current document. You can also access the Palette Delete Panel directly. Palette Delete Panel \ue157 The Palette Delete Panel allows a user to delete an existing palette. The only palettes that cannot be deleted is the Favorites palette and the Current Colors palette (if enabled). To delete a palette, a user simply clicks a palette and it will be removed. Color Panel \ue157 The Color Panel allows you to click a color to insert it at your current color position. You can also bring up the Color Delete Panel from the view's context menu or the command palette. Color Delete Panel \ue157 The Color Delete Panel can delete any color from the given palette. A user simply clicks the color to remove, and it will be removed. Settings \ue157 Settings for Color Helper are contained within the color_helper.sublime-settings file. auto_popup \ue157 Enable/disable auto popups. // Show popups automatically in configured files. \"auto_popup\" : true , inline_previews \ue157 Enable/disable inline color previews. inline_previews generates an image previews after the identified color in your source file. You can click the preview to bring up the ColorHelper panel. inline_preview_offset \ue157 ColorHelper does it best to calculate the correct size for inline images, but with some font's or screen resolutions (or for a reason I don't quite understand) it will get it wrong and create an image larger (or maybe smaller) than your line height which may cause an undesirable look. Set this value to either a positive or negative value which will be applied to the inline preview's image size. // Adjust the size of inline image previews by the offset given. // Please use either a positive or negative number. \"inline_preview_offset\" : 0 , If you need to set this per OS or per host, you can via multiconf . inline_preview_position \ue157 Previews can be positioned to the left or right of a color. Set this value to \"left\" or \"right to toggle its behavior. // Adjust the position of inline image previews. // (left|right) \"inline_preview_position\" : \"left\" , upper_case_hex \ue157 When inserting a color from the tooltip, this setting will determine if hex colors get uppercased or lowercased. // Upper case hex when inserting \"upper_case_hex\" : false , use_webcolor_names \ue157 Will determine if a HTML color name will be shown for the currently selected colors. If inserting a web color name, transparency will be removed. // Use webcolor names when value color matches a webcolor name. \"use_webcolor_names\" : true , click_color_box_to_pick \ue157 This will make the color preview box in the Color Info Panel clickable. When set to color_picker and clicked, it will open the color picker via the ColorPicker plugin (if installed). When set to palette_picker and clicked, it will open the Palette Panel . The respective menu item will not be shown in the Color Info Panel once relocated to the color preview. // Color picker and palette picker by default // are accessed by clicking an icon on the color info panel. // Click access for one of thesecan be moved to the color box // (visual representation of the color). // (none|color_picker|palette_picker) \"click_color_box_to_pick\" : \"none\" , graphic_size \ue157 Coarse scaling of the size of generated graphics. Graphics in the tooltips look best large as Sublime slightly distorts images, but on different screens, some of the tooltips (especially the internal color picker) may be too large or too small. graphic_size can be used to control the size of these generated images.

Border cannot be applied to images with CSS, so this option was exposed to allow user override. Colors specified in the setting must be of the form #RRGGBB . null can be used to turn remove your override. // Override image border color.

They are used to filter views that will be targeted for scanning. Depending on how syntax_filter is set, syntax_files will either require the files to be in the list or not in the list. If syntax_files is set as an empty array, all views will be targeted unless filtered further by other settings. Assuming that you have a tmLanguage file Packages/CSS/CSS.tmLanguage : \"color_scanning\" : [ { \"syntax_files\" : [ \"CSS/CSS\" ], color_scanning.syntax_filter \ue157 syntax_filter will cause syntax_files to be treated as either a blacklist or whitelist . Acceptable values are \"blacklist\" and \"whitelist\" . \"whitelist\" is the default setting. \"color_scanning\" : [ { \"syntax_filter\" : \"whitelist\" , color_scanning.base_scopes \ue157 base_scopes is used to target specific file views that are syntax highlighted with a specific base scope. This allows you to target multiple syntax highlighters that all use the same base scope. base_scopes is an array; if the array is left empty, all views will be targeted unless filtered further by other settings. \"color_scanning\" : [ { \"base_scopes\" : [ \"source.css\" ], color_scanning.extensions \ue157 extensions is used to target specific file views that a file name with the specified extension(s). extensions is an array; if the array is left empty, all views will be targeted unless filtered further by other settings.

Scopes in this array contain usually tmTheme scope syntax, so you can include scopes or exclude scopes etc. In the example below, we target meta.property-value.css , but only if it is not also scoped as a string or a comment . \"color_scanning\" : [ { \"scan_scopes\" : [ \"meta.property-value.css -comment -string\" ] color_scanning.scan_completion_scopes \ue157 scan_completion_scopes is an array of scopes that will be searched for certain syntax for color completions. This is used only if scan_scopes is not sufficient to also capture colors that need to be completed. For example: sometimes scan_scopes is not broad enough to capture incomplete colors, but we don't want to generally want to scan so broadly when scanning an entire file for complete colors. Scopes in this array contain usually tmTheme scope syntax, so you can include scopes or exclude scopes etc. In the example below, we target source.scss and source.sass , but only if they are not also scoped as string or comment . \"color_scanning\" : [ { \"scan_completion_scopes\" : [ \"source.scss -comment -string\" , \"source.sass -comment -string\" ], color_scanning.allowed_colors \ue157 allowed_colors defines which colors will be scanned for in a specific file.

For the settings that have this enabled, you can optionally use the format below to specify the setting per OS or per host. The optional multiconf format requires a dictionary with a special identifier #multiconf# and a list of dictionaries identified by a qualifier of the form \"<qualifier name>:<qualifier value>[;<qualifier name>:<qualifier value>]...\" For example, the following setting \"user_home\" : \"/home\" would result in get(\"user_home\") returning the value \"/home\" but it could also be replaced with \"user_home\" : { \"#multiconf#\" : [ { \"os:windows\" : \"C:\\\\Users\" }, { \"os:linux;host:his_pc\" : \"/home\" }, { \"os:linux;host:her_pc\" : \"/home/her/special\" } ] } Now the same configuration file will provide different values depending on the machine it's on.

The optional multiconf format requires a dictionary with a special identifier #multiconf# and a list of dictionaries identified by a qualifier of the form \"<qualifier name>:<qualifier value>[;<qualifier name>:<qualifier value>]...\" For example, the following setting \"user_home\" : \"/home\" would result in get(\"user_home\") returning the value \"/home\" but it could also be replaced with \"user_home\" : { \"#multiconf#\" : [ { \"os:windows\" : \"C:\\\\Users\" }, { \"os:linux;host:his_pc\" : \"/home\" }, { \"os:linux;host:her_pc\" : \"/home/her/special\" } ] } Now the same configuration file will provide different values depending on the machine it's on. On an MS Windows machine the value returned by get will be \"C:\\Users\", and on a Linux machine with the host name his_pc the value will be \"/home\", etc.","title":"Multiconf"},{"location":"_snippets/abbr/","text":"","title":"Abbr"},{"location":"_snippets/links/","text":"","title":"Links"},{"location":"_snippets/refs/","text":"","title":"Refs"}]}
