# ColorHelper

## 3.1.1

- **FIX**: Fix Windows color picker not processing color properly.
- **FIX**: Make sure Windows color picker stores and retrieves custom colors.

## 3.1.0

- **NEW**: Drop support for ColorPicker package and instead implement OS color pickers  
  directly in ColorHelper. Linux users will need to install [`kcolorchooser`](https://apps.kde.org/en/kcolorchooser),  
  and it must be in the path on the command line

## 3.0.2

- **FIX**: Fix typo in color trigger pattern in 3.0.1 fix.

## 3.0.1

- **FIX**: Ignore color keywords when they are preceded by `$` (SCSS). Also fix issue  
  with `-` trailing a keyword.

## 3.0.0

- **NEW**: New supported color spaces: `lch`, `lab`, `display-p3`, `rec-2020`, `xyz`,  
  `prophoto-rgb`, `a98-rgb`, and `hsv`.
- **NEW**: `rgb`, `hsl`, and `hwb` all support the new CSS format `rgb(r g b / a)`.
- **NEW**: `gray()` dropped as it is no longer part of the CSS level 4 specifications.
- **NEW**: All instances of `blacklist` and `whitelist` are now known as `blocklist`  
  and `allowlist` respectively.
- **NEW**: Outputs, when inserting or converting, can be controlled in settings file.
- **NEW**: Color triggers (what ColorHelper searches for before testing if the text  
  is a color) can be configured in settings file. This can allow a user to not trigger  
  on certain formats.
- **NEW**: If desired, users can provided a custom color class object to use for certain  
  files that can augment one or more supported color space's accepted input and output  
  formats.
- **NEW**: Improvements to scanning. Scanning will only occur in the viewable viewport.  
  Text that is not visible, both vertically or horizontally, will not be scanned until  
  it scrolls into view.
- **NEW**: New option `preview_on_select` to show color previews only when the cursor is  
  on the color or selecting the color (currently only applied to one selection).
- **NEW**: New color edit tool which allows a user to get a live update of the color as  
  they alter the coordinates, and allows the user to mix it with one other color. The  
  result can be inserted back into the file, or will be handed back to the color picker  
  if called from there.
- **NEW**: New color contrast tool which allows a user to see the contrast ratio and  
  see a visual representation of how the two colors contrast. The resulting foreground  
  color can be inserted back into the file, or will be handed back to the color picker  
  if called from there.
- **NEW**: New Sublime ColorMod tool which allows a user to see a `color-mod` expression  
  update a live color preview on the fly.
- **NEW**: Only one color rule (defined in the settings file) will apply to a given view.
- **NEW**: Renamed `color_scan` option to `color_rule`.
- **NEW**: Massive overhaul of color scanning and color scanning options.
- **NEW**: Colors that are out of gamut will be gamut mapped. On hover of the preivew  
  (on ST4), it will indicate that it has been gamut mapped. This can be changed via  
  `show_out_of_gamut_preview`, and additionally a fully transparent color swatch with a  
  "red-ish" border will be shown (color may vary based on color scheme). On mouse over,  
  it will also indicate that it is out of gamut on ST4.
- **NEW**: ColorHelper will now gamut map colors in some scenarios, either due to  
  necessity, or by user setting.
- **NEW**: New `generic` option is defined which provides a default input and output for  
  files with no rules. Users can use the color picker, and other color tools, from any  
  file now. Scanning is disabled by default and can be enabled if desired. `generic` can  
  be tweaked to provide whatever fallback experience the user desired.
- **NEW**: New command added to force scanning in a file that may have scanning disabled.  
  Also can force a file with scanning enabled to be disabled.
- **NEW**: Color helper will now recognize `transparent`.
- **NEW**: Color picker rainbow box will adjust based on the saturation of the current  
  selected color.
- **NEW**: Color picker will give a clear indication when you are at the end of a color  
  channel by showing no more boxes.
- **NEW**: Provide `user_color_rules` where a user can append rules without overwriting the  
  entire rule set. If a rule uses the same `name` as one of the existing default rules,  
  a shallow merge will be done so the values of the top level keys will be overridden  
  with the user keys and/or any additional keys will be added.
- **REMOVED**: Color completion. It mainly got in the way. The palette can be called any  
  time the user needs it.
- **REMOVED**: Hex shaped color picker option has been removed.
- **REMOVED**: Removed "current file palette". ColorHelper will no longer scan the entire  
  current file and generate a palette. This only worked in a limited number of files and  
  added much more complexity.
- **REMOVED**: Various options from rules sets. These are now controlled by the color  
  class object that is being used. For instance, input and output format of colors in the  
  form `#AARRGGBB` instead of the default `#RRGGBBAA` would need to use the new example  
  `ColorHelper.custom.ahex.ColorAhex` custom color object to read in and output hex colors  
  with leading alpha channels.
- **FIX**: Insert logic issues.
- **FIX**: ColorPicker now will always work in the color space of the current mode. This  
  fixes some conversion issues.
