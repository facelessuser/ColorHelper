# ColorHelper 3.1.0

New release!

See `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Changelog` for more info on
the release.

## Breaking Changes

ColorHelper 3.0 is a major overhaul, so existing settings are likely to break.
Please checkout the latest documentation to learn what changed and how to
configure and use the new ColorHelper: https://facelessuser.github.io/ColorHelper/.

You may need to run `Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies`, wait until it finishes
in the console, and then restart Sublime before the latest ColorHelper works.
