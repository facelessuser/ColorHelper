# ColorHelper

New release!

See `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Changelog` for more info on  
prior releases.

A restart of Sublime Text is **strongly** encouraged.

Please report any issues as we _might_ have missed some required updates  
related to the upgrade to stable `coloraide`.
## 6.4.0

-   **NEW**: Opt into Python 3.8.
-   **NEW**: Upgrade ColorAide.
-   **NEW**: Note in documentation and settings a new gamut mapping  
    method, `oklch-raytrace`, which does a chroma reduction much  
    faster and closer than the current suggested CSS algorithm.
-   **NEW**: Add color rule for `ini` files.
-   **FIX**: Fix Less rule.
