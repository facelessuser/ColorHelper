# ColorHelper

New release!

See `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Changelog` for more info on  
prior releases.

A restart of Sublime Text is **strongly** encouraged.

Please report any issues as we _might_ have missed some required updates  
related to the upgrade to stable `coloraide`.

## 6.7.0

-   **NEW**: Rework HTML, CSS, SCSS, SASS handling. As syntax packages  
    have evolved, rework rules to better target colors, combining  
    handling under one rule `HTML/CSS`.
-   **NEW**: Move handling for old, CSS3 syntax to its own rule.
