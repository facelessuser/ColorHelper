# ColorHelper 3.6.0

New release!

See `Preferences->Package Settings->ColorHelper->Changelog` for more info on
prior releases.

Restart of Sublime Text may be required.

## 3.6.0

- **NEW**: Add support for [Advanced Substation Alpha (ASS)](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Advanced%20Substation%20Alpha%20(ASS)).

## Updated from 2.0 to 3.0?

ColorHelper 3.0 is a major overhaul, so existing settings are likely to break.
Please checkout the latest documentation to learn what changed and how to
configure and use the new ColorHelper: https://facelessuser.github.io/ColorHelper/.

You may need to run `Package Control: Satisfy Dependencies`, wait until it finishes
in the console, and then restart Sublime before the latest ColorHelper works.
